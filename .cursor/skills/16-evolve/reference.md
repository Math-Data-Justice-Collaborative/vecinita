# 16-evolve — Reference

Canonical state file: repo-root [`workflow-state.yaml`](../../workflow-state.yaml).
Shared rules: [workflow-state-reference.md](../workflow-state-reference.md).

## Evolve cycle YAML schema

Append to `workflow-state.yaml`:

```yaml

  stage: 16-evolve
  category: contradiction
  issue: "api-contract POST /run conflicts with spec §Batch"
  resolution: null

| Trigger | 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
|---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| New feature Fn in feature-list | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| New config parameter | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| API contract change only | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Test plan / acceptance only | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Execution plan task add (spec already OK) | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| New Cursor rule / hook | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | — |

| New upstream repo / paper | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Legend: ✓ = include by default; — = skip unless user requests.

**03 / 06**: Also run when plan-adherence or template-registry patterns need new guardrails.

**13-deploy-smoke**: Skip only if user explicitly chooses "build + verify, no deploy this cycle".

## Delta mode conventions

When invoking child skills during evolve:

### 01-requirements (delta)

- Open only templates/sections listed in `affected_artifacts`.
- Prefix new content with evolve cycle ID in `docs/decisions.md#requirements-decisions-01-requirements`.
- Do not delete unrelated sections; mark deprecated features with status + ADR if removed.

### 02-verify-plan (delta)

- Full **consistency pass** across all spec docs (contradictions hide at boundaries).
- Statement audit focused on changed sections + any doc that references changed identifiers.

### 04-tech-plan (delta)

- Append tasks to `docs/execution-plan.md`; do not reset completed tasks.
- New milestone/phase only if scope warrants; user approves via AskQuestion.

### 07-build (delta)

- Implement only pending tasks tagged with `evolve_cycle_id` or listed in cycle scope.
- Branch per execution-plan git strategy; PR references evolve cycle in title/body.

## Consistency checklist

Run after 02-verify-plan and 05-verify-tech (and before deploy gate):

- [ ] Every new/changed feature in `feature-list.md` has spec section + test coverage
- [ ] Parameter names match `config-spec.md` (no synonyms)
- [ ] `api-contract.md` matches Modal entry points in `deployment-integration.md`
- [ ] `test-plan.md` and `acceptance-criteria.md` reference same journey IDs
- [ ] `dependency-inventory.md` lists every new package from 04-tech-plan
- [ ] `data-management-plan.md` covers new weights/datasets if any
- [ ] `execution-plan.md` tasks trace to feature IDs
- [ ] New ADRs referenced inline in updated spec sections (`<!-- ADR-NNN -->`)
- [ ] `workflow-state.yaml` §template not contradicted without ADR
- [ ] No orphaned statements in audit reports marked `denied` still present in specs

On any failure: AskQuestion with category, evidence (file + section), and recommended fix.

## decisions.md evolve-cycle section template

Create or append per cycle:

```markdown
# Evolve decisions

## Cycle EV-001 — {title}
**Started**: {date}
**Scope** (approved):
{verbatim scope}

### Intake decisions
| ID | Category | Question | Decision | ADR |
|----|----------|----------|----------|-----|
| E1-1 | decision | ... | ... | ADR-004 |

### Stage log
| Stage | Completed | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| 01-requirements | | |
```

## evolve-report template

Append a new section to `docs/archive/evolve-history.md`:

```markdown
## {cycle-id} — {title}

- **Cycle**: EV-001
- **Status**: completed
- **Scope**: ...
- **Stages run**: 01, 02, 04, 05, 07, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13
- **ADRs**: ADR-004, ADR-005
- **Deploy**: {URL or "not deployed"}
- **Open issues**: ...

## Summary
...

## Artifacts changed
- docs/feature-list.md — added F10
- ...

## Verification
- 09-qa: pass
- 10-e2e: pass (journeys UJ-013, UJ-014)
```

## Handoff to 14 / 15

| Outcome | Next skill |
|---------|------------|
| Production bug found during 09/10/13 | [14-hotfix](../14-hotfix/SKILL.md) with repro test |
| Deploy OK but ops uncertainty | [15-service-health](../15-service-health/SKILL.md) |
| Scope grew beyond cycle | New evolve cycle EV-{N+1} — do not expand silently |

---

## Fn allocation (multi-feature cycles)

**Default:** one evolve cycle, multiple Fn (F19, F20, F21).

1. Open `docs/feature-list.md` Summary table.
2. Assign next ids sequentially (highest F# + 1, +2, …).
3. Add rows: `| Fnn | {title} | Planned | {category} | {apps} | 16-evolve EV-NNN |`
4. Add **Feature Details** §Fnn for each feature.
5. Update cross-linked docs in `affected_artifacts` — do not delete unrelated Fn.

Removed features: mark Deprecated + ADR; never reuse Fn ids.

## Feature intake batches

Use **AskQuestion** per batch (2–4 questions). Wait for all answers before the next batch.
For **multiple features**, repeat behavior/platform batches per feature or group related Fn.

### Batch 1 — Problem

| Prompt theme | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Who uses this and when? | Personas, journey anchor |
| What problem does it solve? | Motivation |
| How will we know it works? | Measurable success |

### Batch 2 — Behavior

| Prompt theme | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Primary user flow (step by step) | user-journeys.md |
| Inputs and outputs (types, formats) | spec, api-contract |
| Error / empty / loading behavior | test-plan edge cases |

### Batch 3 — Boundaries

| Prompt theme | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Explicitly out of scope | Scope creep guard |
| Breaking API or config changes? | versioning, deploy risk |
| Privacy / PII / retention | Vecinita guardrails |

### Batch 4 — Platform

| Prompt theme | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Which app(s): chat-rag, data-mgmt, database, Modal? | feature-list Category/App |
| New env vars or secrets? | config-spec, 12-verify-deploy |
| Browser / CORS / VITE_* changes? | connectivity-gates |

### Batch 5 — Quality & tests

| Prompt theme | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Latency / throughput expectations | 04-tech-plan, perf in test-plan |
| Acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then) | test-plan, 11-verify-impl |
| Smoke vs full E2E tier (T0/T2/T3) | 10-e2e, 13-deploy-smoke |

## Default routing (net-new feature(s))

| Stage | Default |
|-------|---------|
| 00-context | Skip |
| 01-requirements | Run (delta) |
| 02-verify-plan | Run |
| 03-plan-tooling | Run if new guardrails; else confirm skip via AskQuestion |
| 04-tech-plan | Run |
| 05-verify-tech | Run |
| 06-tech-tooling | Run if new deps or hooks |
| 07-build, 08 | Run |
| 09-qa, 10-e2e | Run (parallel) |
| 11-verify-impl | Run — **user signs off each Fn** |
| 12, 13 | Run unless user waives deploy |

## Checkpoint digest

After phases A, B, C, D, and deploy — present to user before continuing:

```markdown
## Evolve cycle {EV-NNN} — {title}

**Phase completed:** {A|B|C|D|Deploy}
**Feature IDs:** {F19, F20, F21}
**Stages run:** {list}
**Specs touched:** {paths}
**Code:** branch `{branch}`, commits {n}, PR {url or "none"}
**Tests:** pytest {pass/fail}
**Smokes:** {H1–H5 summary or "not run"}
**Open issues:** {issue_log ids or "none"}

### What changed (plain language)
{2–4 sentences}

### Your review
- Does behavior match what you asked for?
- Any acceptance scenario missing?
```

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| pytest summary | Last `08-verify-build` or local run |
| E2E / smoke | `docs/sessions/{id}/reports/e2e-report.md`, deploy H1–H5 |
| Spec paths | `evolve_cycles[].artifacts` |
| PR URL | `git_history` / gh |
| Acceptance | `docs/test-plan.md` rows per Fn |

## Spec documents typically touched (features)

| Document | Typical delta |
|----------|----------------|
| `docs/feature-list.md` | New Fn rows + details |
| `docs/spec.md` | Component behavior |
| `docs/user-journeys.md` | New or extended journey |
| `docs/test-plan.md` | Tests + H tiers |
| `docs/acceptance-criteria.md` | Fn acceptance |
| `docs/config-spec.md` | New parameters |
| `docs/api-contract.md` | New/changed endpoints |
| `docs/execution-plan.md` | Tasks, milestones |
| `docs/dependency-inventory.md` | New packages |
| `docs/data-management-plan.md` | Corpus/schema if ingest changes |

Prefix decisions in `docs/decisions.md#requirements-decisions-01-requirements` / `docs/decisions.md#technical-decisions-05-verify-tech` with
`EV-NNN / Fnn`.
