# Cross-cutting considerations (`.cursor/skills`)

Use this file from any skill here so behavior stays aligned without copying long prose into every `SKILL.md`.

## 1. Root cause: spec vs code vs infra

Before choosing a fix path, classify the failure:

| Kind | Signals | Typical remediation |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **Spec / docs wrong** | Acceptance criteria, test plan, or deployment plan contradict requirements or reality; validation "fails" but implementation matches code + spec mismatch | Correct the specific spec section, then re-run only the affected check. **Do not re-run entire phases.** |
| **Code wrong** | Implementation diverges from audited spec; unit/integration failures with clear spec reference | Targeted code fix in the build branch. |
| **Infra / ops** | Secrets, image build, platform quotas, network; deploy succeeds but runtime misconfigured | Deploy-verify / platform fixes. |
| **Tooling gap** | Hook or rule fails to catch an issue it should have caught | Patch the specific hook or rule. |

Individual skills handle local failures; **cross-stage issues** (e.g., deploy exposes a spec error) need explicit handoff (workflow-state.yaml issue_log, execution-plan notes).

### Fix in place (D10)

The pipeline uses **fix in place** — targeted patches rather than re-running entire phases:
- Code bugs: patch the code, re-run affected test
- Spec mismatches: patch the spec section surgically
- Missing features: add task to execution plan, implement
- Tooling gaps: patch the hook or rule
- Never reset phase status or re-run upstream stages unless the user explicitly requests it
- Post-deployment fixes use [14-hotfix](14-hotfix/SKILL.md) — same fix-in-place principle, dedicated triage + branch workflow
- Production investigation (deploy drift, API/DB health, ingest backlog) uses [15-service-health](15-service-health/SKILL.md) — report first; code fixes still go through 14-hotfix
- **Every caught failure** uses [bug-investigation](bug-investigation/SKILL.md): one `docs/bug-reports/BUG-*.md` (logs + persistent investigation), one `tests/bugs/test_bug_*.py` (red → green), one fix; interactive gates via AskQuestion only

### Implementation throughput

**07-build** should complete as many tasks and milestones as practical in **one agent invocation**: open PRs when milestones/phases complete, but do not treat each PR as the end of the session unless the user asked for that cadence.

## 2. Feedback loop (non-linear remediation)

The default pipeline is **linear**, but **recovery** is allowed when validation shows something was wrong.

1. **Record**: Append to `workflow-state.yaml` issue_log with category, evidence, and affected artifacts.
2. **Classify**: Is this a code, spec, infra, or tooling issue? (see §1)
3. **Fix in place**: Apply the targeted patch. Do not re-run entire phases.
4. **Re-verify**: Re-run only the affected check, not the full verification suite.
5. **Staleness**: After spec edits, check if downstream artifacts consumed the old version. If yes, warn the user but do not automatically re-run.

## 3. Release notes and changelog

Atomic commits and PRs use structured messages, but **nothing automatically becomes** user-facing **release notes**.

**Convention** (when cutting a release or completing 13-deploy-smoke):
- Append a release section to `docs/deploy-report.md` or maintain `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Aggregate merge commits and PR titles since the last deploy tag
- Include: version/date, deployment URL, merged milestones, notable decisions

## 4. Performance testing

| Stage | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **01-requirements / 04-tech-plan** | Ensure specs cover query latency, ingest throughput, embedding/LLM cost, and DB sizing where requirements imply them. Stack choices per [deployment-catalog.md](deployment-catalog.md). If unknown, surface `[Ambiguity]`. |
| **08-verify-build** | When test-plan.md defines perf commands/thresholds, run them. |
| **09-qa** | Report perf-related findings in QA report. |
| **13-deploy-smoke** | Post-deploy smoke: H1–H3 **plus** H4–H5 browser connectivity per [connectivity-gates.md](connectivity-gates.md). |

If perf requirements are unknown, surface `[Ambiguity]` during planning — do not invent SLOs.

## 5. Security considerations

Every skill that touches dependencies, secrets, or deployment should be security-aware:

| Stage | Check | Action on failure |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **00-context** | Flag hardcoded secrets in repo | `[Decision]` — use secrets management |
| **01-requirements** | Note security requirements in specs | Include in user-journeys.md and test-plan.md |
| **04-tech-plan** | Include security scan in hooks/CI | Add pip-audit, secret scan |
| **07-build** | Never commit secrets | Pre-commit hook |
| **08-verify-build** | Run dependency vulnerability scan | Surface with approve/deny/modify |
| **09-qa** | Full security scan (CVEs, secrets, patterns) | Report in QA report |
| **12-verify-deploy** | Verify secrets management, no .env deployed | Block deploy if exposed |

Security findings are **always blocking** — do not silently suppress.

## 6. Data & corpus management (Vecinita)

RAG services need schema, seed corpus, and eval fixtures before integration tests pass:

| Stage | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **00-context** | Identify existing DB, vector extension, corpus sources |
| **01-requirements** | Data management scope in specs (ingest, retention, ACLs) |
| **04-tech-plan** | `docs/data-management-plan.md`, migration tasks |
| **data-management** skill | Migrations + seed + verify before build |
| **07-build** | Block tasks that need DB until data-management is `complete` |
| **12-verify-deploy** | Migrations on target env; no dev fixtures in production |

## 7. Uncertainty / AskQuestion protocol

### Categories

| Category | Blocking? | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Decision** | Yes | Multiple valid approaches |
| **Ambiguity** | Yes | Under-defined requirement |
| **Contradiction** | Yes | Sources disagree |
| **Bloat** | Advisory | Content adds noise |
| **Uncertainty** | Advisory | Low confidence fact |

### Rules

1. **Never silently resolve** a blocking issue. Always surface via AskQuestion.
2. **Batch** multiple issues in a single AskQuestion call when found at the same stage.
3. **First option = recommendation** with rationale.
4. **Last option** = "Let me explain / provide more context" escape hatch.
5. **Advisory issues** proceed with recommended option if user doesn't respond, marked `⚠️ Assumed:`.
6. **Evidence required**: Cite the source (spec section, code path, user answer).

## 8. ADR logging

Every decision surfaced via AskQuestion that selects between multiple valid approaches
must be recorded as an **Architecture Decision Record** in `docs/adr/`.

### When to create an ADR

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `[Decision]` resolved by user | REST vs gRPC, SQL vs NoSQL, deploy target |
| `[Contradiction]` resolved by choosing one side | Paper says X, repo does Y — user picks Y |
| `[Ambiguity]` resolved with a non-obvious default | "Standard preprocessing" clarified as specific steps |
| Tech choice made during interview | Framework, library, or tool selection |
| On-the-fly decision during build | New dependency added, algorithm changed |
| Scope decision during verification | Feature added, deferred, or removed |

Do **not** create ADRs for:
- Auto-approved high-confidence statements (user explicitly stated the fact)
- Advisory issues resolved with the recommended default (`⚠️ Assumed:`)
- Formatting, naming, or style choices already covered by linter rules

### ADR format

Use the template in `docs/adr/`:

```markdown
# ADR-{NNN}: {Title}

> **Status**: Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated
> **Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
> **Deciders**: {who made this decision}
> **Stage**: {pipeline stage where decision was made, e.g., 01-requirements}

## Context
{What problem or question triggered this decision?}

## Decision
{What was decided and why?}

## Alternatives Considered
| # | Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Rejected |
|---|-------------|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Consequences
### Positive
- ...
### Negative
- ...

## References
- {spec section, user answer, or evidence that informed the decision}
```

### Numbering

ADR numbers are sequential across all stages. Read `docs/adr/` to find the next
available number. Never reuse a number.

### Cross-referencing

When an ADR is created:
1. Add a reference in the stage's decision log (e.g., `product-decisions.md`,
   `tech-decisions.md`, `requirements-decisions.md`)
2. If the decision affects a spec document, add an inline citation:
   `<!-- ADR-{NNN} -->` next to the affected claim
3. Add the ADR path to `workflow-state.yaml` §artifacts

### Superseding

When a later decision overrides an earlier one:
1. Set the old ADR's status to `Superseded by ADR-{NNN}`
2. Reference the old ADR in the new one's Context section

## 9. Multi-app browser connectivity (skills 00–15)

Hybrid deploys (static frontend on host A, API on host B) require **two** wiring layers plus
**integration** tests for server-side paths:

| Layer | Mechanism | Verified by |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| In-process integration | APIs + DB + mocked upstreams | **H0i** `tests/integration` |
| Build-time | `VITE_*` baked into JS | **H5** bundle check |
| Run-time | `VECINITA_CORS_ORIGINS` on APIs | **H0c** unit + **H4** live |

**Every pipeline skill 00–15** has stage-specific obligations in
[connectivity-gates.md](connectivity-gates.md) §Pipeline stages 00–15. The orchestrator
([pipeline/SKILL.md](pipeline/SKILL.md)) enforces phase gates that reference those rows.

Do not treat `curl` API smokes (H1–H3) or Vitest mocks as proof the UI works in production.

## 10. Template conformance

When a project is built from an org template (see [template-registry.md](template-registry.md)),
every stage should respect the template's structural patterns:

| Concern | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **File layout** | Do not create files outside the template's expected structure without an ADR |
| **Service layout** | API vs worker vs monolith per [template-registry.md](template-registry.md) |
| **Separation of concerns** | RAG core in `src/rag/` — no FastAPI/DB imports in pure retrieval tests |
| **Naming** | Service id `vecinita`; routers and tables match `docs/api-contract.md` |
| **CI/CD** | Deploy workflow matches template pattern; changes require an ADR |
| **Drift detection** | Template-structural changes have higher blast radius than domain-specific changes. Surface as `[Template Drift]` when detected without a prior ADR. |

**Template drift is advisory, not blocking** — it warns but does not prevent the change.
If the user approves the drift, create an ADR documenting the deviation and why it was
accepted. The template is a starting point, not a cage.

## 11. State management

### YAML state

The pipeline uses repo-root [`workflow-state.yaml`](../workflow-state.yaml) as the **only**
canonical pipeline state file. Full schema, skill→key mapping, and update rules:
[workflow-state-reference.md](workflow-state-reference.md).

- Tracks pipeline stages 00–17 plus auxiliary keys (`gather-context`, `build-planner`, …)
- Phase gates with criteria checklists
- `issue_log` for cross-stage issues
- `decisions_log` for user decisions
- `artifacts` list; `evolve_cycles` / `retrospective_cycles` for 16/17

### Per-skill detail state

Detail files (e.g. `docs/execution-plan.md` §Current State for 07-build,
`docs/deploy-state.md` for deploy) hold substeps. **Stage completion** must still be written
to `workflow-state.yaml` immediately. Do not use legacy-only files
(`gather-context-state.md`, `audit-state.md`) without mirroring into YAML.

### Persistence rules

- State writes are **immediate** — never buffer
- Every substep completion triggers a state write
- If a session ends mid-skill, all progress up to the last completed substep is preserved
- On re-invocation, the state file determines resume position

### Commit-as-you-go (§12)

All skills that produce files **must commit before**:

1. Transitioning to the next stage
2. Asking the user a blocking AskQuestion
3. Running a gate check
4. Ending a session/turn

Branch naming by change type, commit recording in `git_history`, and per-skill branch
type: see [workflow-state-reference.md](workflow-state-reference.md) §Git history.

| Change type | Branch pattern |
|-------------|----------------|
| Feature / milestone | `feat/{slug}` |
| Bug fix | `fix/{slug}` |
| Docs-only | `docs/{slug}` |
| Skill / tooling | `chore/{slug}` |
| Infra / deploy | `infra/{slug}` |
| Evolve cycle | `evolve/{cycle-id}-{slug}` |

Every commit appends to `workflow-state.yaml` §`git_history.commits` with stage
attribution. The git history in workflow-state is the persistent record that survives
session boundaries — on resume, read it to know what was committed and where.
