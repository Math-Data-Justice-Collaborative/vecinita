# 00 — Context Gathering

Analyze existing artifacts (codebase, paper, docs, prior work) and produce a structured
context brief for downstream skills.

**Preamble:** [pipeline-preamble.md](../pipeline-preamble.md) — shared conventions for stages 00–17.
**Sessions:** [sessions-reference.md](../sessions-reference.md) — **session opener**; allocates
`SNNN-slug`, routing plan, `active_session`.
**Cross-cutting:** [considerations.md](../considerations.md), [connectivity-gates.md](../connectivity-gates.md).
**State agent:** [workflow-state-manager](../../agents/workflow-state-manager.md) — mandatory read/update.

## Planning only — plan, don't build

This is a **planning stage** (see [pipeline-preamble.md](../pipeline-preamble.md) §18). It analyzes
artifacts and writes `docs/` context — it does **not** write product/feature source code under
`src/`, `apps/`, or `packages/`. If the user asks to implement a feature now, capture it for
**07-build** and AskQuestion `[Scope Drift]` rather than writing application code in this stage.

## Phase 0 — Session open (default)

Run **before** context gathering when user intent implies bounded work (almost always).

1. If `active_session` exists: AskQuestion — resume / close and start new / abandon.
2. Classify **session type** per [sessions-reference.md](../sessions-reference.md) §11.
3. Propose the routing plan from default presets (§12); document skip rationale per omitted stage.
4. **AskQuestion** — user approves or edits the routing plan.
5. Agent `open_session` (a single call, **after** approval): increment `session_counter`,
   allocate `S{NNN}-{slug}`, and set `active_session` with the approved `routing_plan` and
   `artifacts_dir: docs/sessions/SNNN-slug/`. The agent rejects this call if an `active_session`
   already exists (handle the existing one via step 1 first).
6. Create `docs/sessions/SNNN-slug/` with `session-brief.md` (intent, type, scope) and
   `routing-plan.md` (the approved plan).
7. Create branch `feat/SNNN-slug` (or `fix/`, `evolve/` per type).
8. Route to orchestrator when applicable:
   - `greenfield` → [pipeline](../pipeline/SKILL.md)
   - `feature` / `new_service` → [16-evolve](../16-evolve/SKILL.md)
   - `hotfix` → [14-hotfix](../14-hotfix/SKILL.md)
   - others → first stage in routing plan

Skip Phase 0 only when resuming an existing `active_session` or the user explicitly waived
session orchestration (record via agent `decisions_log`).

## Connectivity (stage 00)

In `docs/sessions/S000-internal-docs-archive/context-brief.md`, document **multi-app topology**: which deployables are browser-facing,
which API origins they call, and whether CORS or a BFF is planned. Flag **browser integration risk**
when static UI and APIs are on different hosts (Vecinita hybrid default).

## When to Use

- **Before 01-requirements**: When the user has existing code, papers, docs, or prior work
  to analyze before the product requirements interview.
- **Standalone**: When you need a deep understanding of existing artifacts without planning.

**When to skip**: The user has no existing artifacts and will provide all requirements via
interviews in Stage 01. Set status to `skipped` in `workflow-state.yaml`.

## Uncertainty Resolution Protocol

Follow the protocol defined in [considerations.md](../considerations.md) §Uncertainty.
Surface all Decisions, Ambiguities, Contradictions, Bloat, and Uncertainty via AskQuestion.

### What to surface

| Category | Trigger | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Decision** | Multiple valid approaches or interpretations | Paper describes baseline and ablation winner — which is canonical for implementation? |
| **Ambiguity** | Under-defined requirement, term, or scope | Paper says "standard preprocessing" without specifying steps |
| **Contradiction** | Sources disagree | Paper reports metric X, repo eval script targets metric Y |
| **Bloat** | Content adds noise without clear value | Repo bundles unrelated visualization notebooks |
| **Uncertainty** | Low confidence in a fact, no corroboration | Dependency imported but never visibly called |

### Batching

Group issues by category into batched AskQuestion calls. Blocking issues (Decision,
Contradiction, Ambiguity) must be resolved before proceeding. Advisory issues (Bloat,
Uncertainty) proceed with recommended option if user does not respond, marked with
`⚠️ Assumed:` prefix.

## Inputs

Collect from the user (check conversation context or ask):

| Input | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| Input type | Yes | — | paper, repo, docs, or combination |
| Paper path | If paper | — | JATS XML, PDF, or markdown |
| Repo URL or local path | If repo | — | GitHub URL or local filesystem path |
| Existing docs | If docs | — | Paths to existing documentation |
| Org directory | No | — | Parent directory containing sibling repos (e.g., `C:\Users\...\CogniChem`). When provided, enables ecosystem scanning (Phase 1B). If omitted, ask whether the project belongs to a multi-repo organization. |
| Output directory | No | `docs/` | Where to write context-brief.md |

## Session management (session opener)

**00-context** opens sessions — it does **not** require a pre-existing `active_session`.

- **Phase 0** allocates `SNNN-slug`, writes `session-brief.md` and `routing-plan.md`, and sets
  `active_session` (via agent `open_session`) after user approval.
- Context phases (1A–4) run per **project** / **scoped** mode; link outputs in `session-brief.md`.
- **Session close:** when the routing plan is complete, checkpoint AskQuestion → agent `close_session`.

See [sessions-reference.md](../sessions-reference.md) §4 and §11.

## State management

**Agent protocol:** [workflow-state-agent-protocol.md](../workflow-state-agent-protocol.md).
**Stage key:** `stages.00-context`.

Invoke **workflow-state-manager** `read_context` before any other action; `update` after each
substep. **Do not** edit `workflow-state.yaml` directly.


### On invocation — check state

1. Use **workflow-state-manager** context brief for §stages.00-context (from agent `read_context`).
2. **If `completed`**: Ask the user:
   - "Reuse the existing context brief as-is"
   - "Update — re-run only for new/changed inputs"
   - "Regenerate — start from scratch"
   - "Let me explain / provide more context"
3. **If `in_progress`**: Report which phases completed. Ask:
   - "Resume from where we left off"
   - "Restart from the beginning"
4. **If `failed`**: Report which phase failed and why. Ask:
   - "Retry the failed phase"
   - "Restart from the beginning"
   - "Abort — I'll fix the issue first"
5. **If `skipped` or `pending`**: Start fresh.

### State updates

After each phase completes (or fails), immediately update `workflow-state.yaml`:
- Set the phase status
- Update agent status after Phase 1A
- Update ecosystem scan status after Phase 1B (repos discovered, repos selected,
  constraints found, patterns adopted)
- Update issue tracking after Phases 2 and 3
- Set overall status to `completed` after Phase 4

Phase 1B state schema:

```yaml
phase1b_ecosystem:
  status: completed | skipped | in_progress | failed
  org_directory: "<path>"
  repos_discovered: <N>
  repos_selected: [<names>]
  constraints_found: <N>
  patterns_adopted: <N>
  divergence_risks: <N>
```

### Commit-as-you-go

Commit artifacts to an appropriate branch before transitioning to the next stage or
asking the user a blocking question. Branch type per
[workflow-state-reference.md](../workflow-state-reference.md) §Git history.
Record every commit in `workflow-state.yaml` §`git_history.commits` with
`stage: "00-context"`.

## Delta / feature-addition mode

When invoked from **16-evolve** or user adds features with new upstream paper/repo context:

- Run only for **new external context** not already in `docs/sessions/S000-internal-docs-archive/context-brief.md`.
- Merge findings into context-brief; do not regenerate unrelated sections.
- Tag agent updates with `evolve_cycle_id` and affected `feature_ids`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1A — Run Analysis Agents

Launch available agents in parallel using the Task tool:

**If paper provided — paper-analyst**:
- Invoke with the paper path
- Extract build, run, test, and config insights
- Use `subagent_type: "paper-analyst"` with appropriate model

**If repo provided — repo-researcher**:
- Invoke with the repository URL/path
- Produce comprehensive implementation guide
- Use `subagent_type: "repo-researcher"` with appropriate model

**If existing docs provided — doc-scanner**:
- Invoke with doc paths
- Extract requirements, architecture decisions, constraints, tech choices
- Use `subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`

Wait for all launched agents to complete. Store their full outputs.

**State**: Update agent status for all agents. Set Phase 1A to `completed`.

### Phase 1B — Ecosystem Scan (Sibling Repos)

Scan sibling repositories in the user's organization directory to identify integration
patterns, shared conventions, and dependencies this project must respect.

**When to run**: Always run when the project belongs to a multi-repo organization.
If the user hasn't provided an org directory, ask:

```
Does this project belong to a multi-repo organization (e.g., a company or org with
other repos in a shared parent directory)?

- "Yes — here's the path: ..."
- "No — this is a standalone project"
- "Let me explain / provide more context"
```

If standalone, skip Phase 1B and set its status to `skipped`.

#### Step 1 — Discover sibling repos

List all directories in the org directory. For each, determine if it's a git repo
(check for `.git/`). Record the repo name and whether it appears active (has recent
commits).

#### Step 2 — Classify repos

For each discovered repo, do a lightweight scan (README, package manifest, entry points)
to classify it:

| Classification | Heuristics |
|----------------|------------|
| **Backend API** | Has server framework (FastAPI, Flask, Express), `routes/`, `endpoints/` |
| **Frontend app** | Has `package.json` with React/Vue/Svelte, `src/components/` |
| **Compute service** | Has Modal/Lambda/Cloud Run config, GPU-heavy deps |
| **Shared library** | Published package, imported by other repos |
| **Data/ML pipeline** | Has training scripts, model configs, dataset loaders |
| **Infrastructure** | Has Terraform, Docker Compose, CI/CD configs, MCP server |
| **Widget/embed** | Has embed script, iframe config, widget build |
| **Documentation** | Primarily markdown, blog posts, knowledge base |
| **Other** | Doesn't match above patterns |

Present the classification table to the user:

```
Found [N] sibling repos in [org_directory]:

| # | Repo | Classification | Key Indicators |
|---|------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | back-end-api | Backend API | FastAPI, /routes |
| 2 | modal-boltz | Compute service | Modal, GPU deps |
| ...
```

#### Step 3 — User selects relevant repos

Ask the user which repos are relevant to the current project via AskQuestion.
**This is blocking** — the user's selection determines what gets scanned in depth.

```
Which of these repos does [current_project] need to integrate with or follow
patterns from?

Select all that apply:
- [each repo as a checkbox option]
- "None — this project is independent"
- "Let me explain / provide more context"
```

Also ask an open-ended question:

```
What should I look for in these repos? Common reasons:
- "API contracts this project must conform to"
- "Shared deployment patterns (Modal config, image builds, secrets)"
- "Naming conventions, code style, shared utilities"
- "Data flow — how this project sends/receives data from others"
- "Auth patterns — how services authenticate with each other"
- "All of the above"
- "Let me explain / provide more context"
```

#### Step 4 — Deep scan selected repos

For each user-selected repo, launch a `subagent_type: "explore"` agent to extract:

1. **Integration surface**: API endpoints, message schemas, event contracts, shared
   types/models that other repos consume or produce
2. **Deployment patterns**: Platform (Modal, Render, AWS, etc.), image build conventions,
   environment variable naming, secrets management, volume mounts
3. **Code conventions**: Package structure, naming patterns, linting/formatting config,
   import conventions, error handling patterns
4. **Data flow**: How data moves between this repo and others — REST calls, queue
   messages, shared databases, file handoffs, Modal volume paths
5. **Auth & networking**: How services authenticate with each other, **CORS / BFF / same-origin**
   for browser clients, internal vs external endpoints — record gaps in context brief per
   [connectivity-gates.md](../connectivity-gates.md) §Stage 00
6. **Shared dependencies**: Common libraries, pinned versions that must stay aligned,
   internal packages imported across repos

Run agents in parallel (one per selected repo). Each agent should return a structured
report following this schema:

```yaml
repo: <name>
classification: <type>
integration_surface:
  endpoints: [...]
  schemas: [...]
  events: [...]
deployment:
  platform: <name>
  image_pattern: <description>
  env_var_conventions: [...]
  secrets_pattern: <description>
code_conventions:
  package_structure: <description>
  naming: <description>
  linting: <tool and config>
data_flow:
  produces: [...]
  consumes: [...]
  shared_storage: [...]
auth:
  pattern: <description>
  internal_endpoints: [...]
shared_deps:
  pinned: [...]
  internal_packages: [...]
```

#### Step 5 — Synthesize ecosystem patterns

After all repo scans complete, synthesize findings into:

1. **Pattern inventory**: Conventions this project should follow to stay consistent
   with the ecosystem (naming, structure, deployment, error handling)
2. **Integration map**: Concrete integration points between this project and scanned
   repos (API calls, shared data, auth flows)
3. **Constraint list**: Hard requirements from sibling repos that constrain choices
   in this project (e.g., must use Modal, must conform to API schema v2, must use
   shared auth token format)
4. **Divergence risks**: Places where this project might diverge from org patterns
   and why that could cause problems

Surface any **Decisions** or **Ambiguities** discovered:
- `[Decision]` "Backend API expects response schema X, but this project's natural
  output is Y — adapt output, or update the API?"
- `[Ambiguity]` "Three repos use different Modal image base layers — which to follow?"

#### Step 6 — User confirms ecosystem constraints

Present the synthesized findings via AskQuestion, grouped:

**Hard constraints** (blocking — must resolve before proceeding):
```
Based on scanning [N] sibling repos, these constraints affect [current_project]:

[Constraint]: The backend API expects POST /api/v1/tools/vecinita with schema {...}
  - "Adopt this contract as-is"
  - "Modify — I'll specify changes"
  - "Ignore — this project won't integrate with the backend"
  - "Let me explain / provide more context"
```

**Recommended patterns** (advisory):
```
These org-wide patterns were found. Adopt them?

[Pattern]: Modal services use `modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(...)` pattern
  - "Adopt"
  - "Skip — I have a reason to diverge"
  - "Let me explain / provide more context"
```

Record all resolutions in the Resolution Log (continuing the R-numbering from Phase 1A).

**State**: Update ecosystem scan status and issue tracking. Set Phase 1B to `completed`.

### Phase 1C — Template Classification

After Phase 1B (or immediately after Phase 1A if 1B was skipped), classify the project
against the [template registry](../template-registry.md) to select a scaffold.

#### Step 1 — Gather classification signals

From all available evidence (agent reports, ecosystem scan, user description), collect:

- **Runtime profile**: Seconds (utility) vs minutes-to-hours (job)
- **GPU requirement**: None/optional (utility) vs required (job)
- **Model weights**: None (utility) vs downloaded on startup (job)
- **State**: Stateless per-request (utility) vs persistent cache volume (job)
- **Job manager**: Not needed (utility) vs `i_am_running()` integration (job)
- **Output format**: `dict` (utility) vs `Tuple[str, bytes]` (job)

#### Step 2 — Classify

Compare signals against the heuristics in `template-registry.md` §Classification
Heuristics. Assign a confidence level:

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **High** | All signals align with one template type |
| **Medium** | Most signals align but 1–2 are ambiguous |
| **Low** | Mixed signals or novel project type |

#### Step 3 — Confirm with user

Present classification via AskQuestion:

```
prompt: "Template classification:
  Project type: [utility / job]
  Confidence:   [high / medium / low]
  Signals:      [bullet list of evidence]
  Template:     template-modal-[utility/job]

  Is this correct?"

options:
  1. "Correct — use this template"
  2. "Wrong type — should be [utility/job instead]"
  3. "Neither — this project doesn't fit these templates"
  4. "Let me explain / provide more context"
```

If overridden by the user, record `overridden_by_user: true` in state.

#### Step 4 — Record template selection

Update `workflow-state.yaml` with the template block:

```yaml
template:
  id: utility | job | none
  repo: template-rag-api | template-rag-worker | null
  selected_at: 00-context
  classification_confidence: high | medium | low
  overridden_by_user: false | true
  gpu_tiers: []
  service_name: ""
```

If a job template is selected, ask which deploy targets to include. Use the full Modal catalog in
[deployment-catalog.md](../deployment-catalog.md) — do not omit tiers that Modal publishes.

```
prompt: "Which deploy targets should this job service support? (Each tier becomes a Modal class
  variant per entry point, e.g. PipelineT4, PipelineH200.)"

options (multi-select; default = all):
  - All tiers — full spread (recommended for production APIs)
  - T4 ($0.000164/s — budget inference, smokes)
  - L4 ($0.000222/s)
  - A10 ($0.000306/s)
  - L40S ($0.000542/s)
  - A100 40GB ($0.000583/s)
  - A100 80GB ($0.000694/s)
  - H100 ($0.001097/s)
  - H200 ($0.001261/s)
  - B200 ($0.001736/s)
  - RTX PRO 6000 ($0.000842/s)
```

If the user selects **All tiers**, set `template.gpu_tiers` to every **tier key** from
deployment-catalog.md (B200, H200, H100, RTX_PRO_6000, A100_80, A100_40, L40S, A10, L4, T4).
Otherwise record only the selected tier keys.

Record the selected tiers in `template.gpu_tiers`.

Also ask for the service name (the `{{SERVICE_NAME}}` replacement value):

```
prompt: "What should the service name be? This becomes the service name
  (cognichem-[name]) and repo name (modal-[name]).
  Example: 'boltz', 'rdkit', 'autodockvina'"
```

Record in `template.service_name`.

**State**: Set Phase 1C to `completed`.

### Phase 2 — Cross-Reference & Detect Issues

Systematically compare agent reports (including ecosystem scan results from Phase 1B
when available). Run seven scans:

1. **Contradiction scan**: Align claims from all sources on shared topics
2. **Ambiguity scan**: Identify under-defined terms, metrics, procedures
3. **Decision scan**: Find points where sources describe multiple approaches
4. **Bloat scan**: Identify tangential content
5. **Uncertainty scan**: Note facts cited by only one source with no corroboration
6. **Data & asset scan**: Identify all external data assets (corpus fixtures, datasets,
   checkpoints, tokenizers, embeddings) with source, size, auth requirements, and
   where code loads them
7. **Ecosystem alignment scan** (if Phase 1B ran): Compare this project's planned
   approach against ecosystem patterns. Flag where the project would diverge from
   established org conventions (deployment, naming, API shape, auth, data flow)

**State**: Update issue tracking with counts. Set Phase 2 to `completed`.

### Phase 3 — Surface Issues to User

Collect all issues from Phase 2. Batch into AskQuestion calls grouped by category.

For each issue:
1. Lead with category label: `[Contradiction]`, `[Decision]`, etc.
2. Include evidence with citations: `[Paper §X]`, `[Repo: path/to/file:L10-20]`
3. Provide a recommended option as first choice
4. Include "Let me explain / provide more context" as last option

Wait for responses to all blocking issues. For advisory issues without response, adopt
the recommended option and mark with `⚠️ Assumed:`.

Record all resolutions in a **Resolution Log**:

```
Resolution Log:
  R1: [Contradiction] Dataset split — User chose: paper's spec (SAbDab 90/10)
  R2: [Bloat] Visualization notebook — User chose: Exclude from scope
  ...
```

**ADR logging**: For each resolved `[Decision]`, `[Contradiction]`, or `[Ambiguity]`
that selects between multiple valid approaches, create an ADR in `docs/adr/` per
[considerations.md](../considerations.md) §ADR logging. Set the Stage field to
`00-context`. Reference the resolution number (R1, R2, ...) in the ADR's Context section.

**State**: Update issue tracking. Set Phase 3 to `completed`.

### Phase 4 — Produce Context Brief

Write `{output_directory}/context-brief.md` with these sections:

1. **Executive Summary** — 3-5 sentence overview of what was analyzed
2. **Template Selection** — selected template ID, repo, confidence, service name,
   deploy targets (if job), user override status. References `template-registry.md`.
3. **Resolution Log** — numbered resolutions from Phases 1B, 1C, and 3
4. **Source Analysis Summaries** — key findings per source (paper, repo, docs)
5. **Ecosystem Analysis** (if Phase 1B ran):
   - **Scanned repos** — table of repos scanned with classifications
   - **Integration map** — concrete integration points with this project
   - **Pattern inventory** — conventions this project should follow
   - **Constraint list** — hard requirements from sibling repos
   - **Divergence risks** — where this project may break org consistency
6. **Cross-Reference Matrix** — alignment table across sources (including ecosystem)
7. **Data & Asset Requirements** — inventory of external assets needed
8. **Unresolved Gaps** — flagged for downstream handling
9. **Full Agent Reports** — collapsible sections with raw agent outputs (including
   ecosystem scan reports)

**State**: Set Phase 4 to `completed`. Set overall status to `completed`.

### Phase 5 — Summary

Report to user:

```
Context Gathering Complete.

Context brief written to: docs/sessions/S000-internal-docs-archive/context-brief.md

Sources analyzed:
  [list of sources with key metrics]

Template:

  Confidence: [high / medium / low]
  deploy targets:  [list, or N/A for utility]

Ecosystem scan:
  Org directory: [path]
  Repos discovered: [N]
  Repos scanned in depth: [N] ([list])
  Constraints identified: [N]
  Patterns to adopt: [N]

```

If Phase 1B was skipped, omit the "Ecosystem scan" block.
If template is `none`, omit "deploy targets" line.

## Output Rules

1. **Evidence-based**: Every claim traces to an agent report. Never fabricate.
2. **Citation format**: `[Paper §X]`, `[Repo: path/to/file:L#]`, `[Docs: path]`
3. **Full reports preserved**: Complete agent outputs in collapsible sections.
4. **Resolution traceability**: Numbered resolutions (R1, R2, ...) referenced downstream.
5. **No silent resolution**: Never resolve blocking issues without user input.
6. **State-managed**: All progress tracked in `workflow-state.yaml`. Immediate writes.
